ðŸ”¥CMake Tools for Neovim written in pure lua that requires Neovim 0.7+.ðŸ”¥

The goal of this plugin is to provide a full-featured, convenient, and powerfull workflow for CMake-based projects in Neovim, which just like [vscode-cmake-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools) for Visual Studio Code.

It uses [CMake file api](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-file-api.7.html) to generate CMake file structure.

It uses terminal to execute targets.

(optional) It uses [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) to debug.

## Notable Features

### CMake Presets

CMake Presets is a "standard" way in cmake to share settings with other people.

Read more about CMake presets from [CMake docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#macro-expansion).

Attention: If `CMake[User]Presets.json` is provided, then `CMakeKits.json` or `CMakeVariants.[json|yaml]` won't have any effect.

### CMake Kits

CMake Kits define rules about how to build code. Typically, a kit can include:

- A set of compilers.
- A toolchain file.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "My Compiler Kit",
  "compilers": {
    "C": "/usr/bin/gcc",
    "CXX": "/usr/bin/g++",
    "Fortran": "/usr/bin/gfortran"
  }
}
```

Read more about cmake kits from [vscode-cmake-tools docs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/docs/kits.md).

**And currently some features are not implemented, see details at [TODO](#todo) section. PR is welcome!**

### CMake Variants

Thanks @toolcreator for supporting CMake Variants which raised by VsCode's CMake Tools.

CMake Variants is a concept of vscode-cmake-tools. It's used to group together and combine a common set of build options.

Read more about cmake variants from [vscode-cmake-tools docs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/docs/variants.md).

## Installation

- Require Neovim (>=0.7)
- Require [plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
- Install it like any other Neovim plugin.
  - [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim): `use 'Civitasv/cmake-tools.nvim'`
  - [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): `Plug 'Civitasv/cmake-tools.nvim'`

## Usage

| Command                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CMakeGenerate\[!\]         | Generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used next. Additional arguments will be passed to CMake. eg. Use `CMakeGenerate -G MinGW\ Makefiles` to specify another generator.                                                                                                                                |
| CMakeBuild                 | Build target, if not generate makefiles yet, it will automatically invoke `CMake`, if not select build target, it will automatically invoke `CMakeSelectBuildTarget` . Additional arguments will be passed to CMake.                                                                                                   |
| CMakeRun                   | Run launch target, if not generate makefiles yet, it will automatically invoke `CMakeGenerate`, if not select launch target, it will automatically invoke `CMakeSelectLaunchTarget`, if not built, it will automatically invoke `CMakeBuild`. Additional arguments will be passed to `CMakeGenerate` and `CMakeBuild`. |
| CMakeDebug                 | Use nvim-dap to debug launch target, works like CMakeRun                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| CMakeSelectBuildType       | Select build type, include "Debug", "Release", "RelWithDebInfo", "MinSizeRel" for default. cmake-tools.nvim also support cmake variants, when "cmake-variants.yaml" or "cmake-variants.json" is provided, it will read configuration from it                                                                           |

## Setup

### Example

```lua
require("cmake-tools").setup {
  cmake_command = "cmake",
  cmake_build_directory = "",
  cmake_build_directory_prefix = "cmake_build_", -- when cmake_build_directory is "", this option will be activated
  cmake_generate_options = { "-D", "CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1" },
  cmake_build_options = {},
  cmake_console_size = 10, -- cmake output window height
  cmake_show_console = "always", -- "always", "only_on_error"
  cmake_dap_configuration = { name = "cpp", type = "codelldb", request = "launch" }, -- dap configuration, optional
  cmake_variants_message = {
    short = { show = true },
    long = { show = true, max_length = 40 }
  }
}
```

The option `cmake_build_directory_prefix` will be activated only when `cmake_build_directory` is set to "".

See detailed user scenario from issue [#21](https://github.com/Civitasv/cmake-tools.nvim/issues/21).
